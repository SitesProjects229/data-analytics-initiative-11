Effective Date: October 14, 2025
Licensor: Shader Effects, Inc., a Delaware C-Corporation (“Shader Effects,” “we,” “us,” or “our”)
Product: Shaders (including all npm packages, components, presets, generated code, and the design platform at shaders.com)

1. Acceptance

By installing, using, or exporting code from Shaders, you (“Licensee”) agree to be bound by this License Agreement (“Agreement”). If you do not agree, you must not use or deploy Shaders or any of its components.

2. License Grant

Subject to payment and compliance with this Agreement, Shader Effects grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to use, modify, and integrate Shaders components and exported code in your own projects, according to the license plan purchased.

Annual License: You may deploy any version of Shaders released during your active subscription term indefinitely, even after expiration, but you may not deploy or upgrade to newer versions until the license is renewed.

Lifetime License: You may deploy all versions of Shaders released during the lifetime of the company and while the npm registry continues to host the licensed packages. Shader Effects makes no guarantee of ongoing updates, support, or compatibility beyond reasonable efforts to maintain them.

Free use is permitted in non-production, educational, demonstration, or evaluation environments. A valid paid license is required for production deployment or any public or commercial use.

3. Prohibited Uses

You may not:

Resell, sublicense, distribute, or repackage Shaders or its components as standalone items.

Use Shaders to create or power a competing tool, library, or service (including design editors, component libraries, visual-effect builders, or shader packs).

Redistribute Shaders presets, effect registries, or exports derived directly from the Shaders Design Editor, except for modified or self-created effects.

Modify or remove any copyright, trademark, or attribution notice (including “Powered by Shaders” references) contained within the code.

Alter or circumvent license validation or metadata features.

Publish or share exported Shaders code or presets publicly as a library or downloadable package.

Use Shaders technology in SaaS products, design tools, or developer frameworks without a separate written OEM or partnership agreement with Shader Effects, Inc.

Official open-source projects may use Shaders without a license key only for their promotional or documentation websites, provided Shaders is not a core or monetized part of the project.

4. Telemetry and License Verification

Shaders may automatically transmit limited, anonymous usage data to Shader Effects’ servers for the purposes of performance tracking, reliability improvement, and license compliance.
This data does not include personal information, but may include information such as the domain name, environment type (development or production), and version identifiers to verify that a valid license is in use.

By using Shaders, you consent to this limited data collection solely for these operational purposes.

5. Right to Promote Usage

Shader Effects reserves the right to publicly identify and promote organizations, products, or websites that use Shaders in production environments, provided no confidential information is disclosed and the representation is factual.

Licensees may request in writing to opt out of promotional use of their name or logo, and Shader Effects will honor such requests within a reasonable timeframe.

6. Intellectual Property

All rights, title, and interest in Shaders—including but not limited to source code, design assets, presets, shaders, and trademarks—remain the exclusive property of Shader Effects, Inc.
Licensees retain ownership of their implementation and integration code, but such work is considered derivative and remains subject to this Agreement.

No ownership or IP rights are transferred under this Agreement. You may not claim or register any intellectual property derived from Shaders.

7. License Compliance and Revocation

Shader Effects reserves the right to audit compliance and revoke, suspend, or deactivate licenses upon evidence of misuse, redistribution, or breach of this Agreement. Upon termination, you must immediately stop deploying or distributing Shaders in any production environment.

8. Disclaimer of Warranties

SHADERS AND ALL ASSOCIATED COMPONENTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR CONTINUOUS AVAILABILITY.

Shader Effects makes no guarantee of uninterrupted access to npm packages, shaders.com, or hosted resources, and assumes no responsibility for maintaining historical versions beyond reasonable efforts.

9. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SHADER EFFECTS, INC. SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE SHADERS.

Shader Effects’ total liability under this Agreement shall not exceed the total fees paid by Licensee for the applicable license.

10. Governing Law and Venue

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and, where applicable, the State of Florida, without regard to conflict of law principles.
Any dispute arising from or relating to this Agreement shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in either Delaware or Florida, and each party irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of those courts.

11. Entire Agreement

This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between Licensee and Shader Effects, Inc. regarding the use of Shaders and supersedes all prior agreements or understandings. Shader Effects reserves the right to update this Agreement, and continued use of Shaders constitutes acceptance of the latest version.
